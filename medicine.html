            <h1>HEADER HERE</h1>

            <p class="introcopy"><span>"Native Strength"</span> is a half-hour television program that can be seen in close to 1,500,000 households and on 47 different stations across the United States.  Cherokee Blessed Woman <span>Hyapatia Lee</span> shares the secrets of centuries-old traditional Native American mindfulness.  This isn’t about spirit guides and crystals but traditional medicine stories to introduce you to your inner children, adults, and elders.  You’ll learn what medicine wheels really are and why the Wheel of Life is the key to understanding them. This information was illegal and buried until 1978. Today the seed has sprouted and is thriving.</p>


            <h1>"Let me introduce you to centuries-old traditional mental health teachings of <span>Turtle Island (North America) known as Native Strength."</span></h1>
            <p class="introcopy">In 2001 Hyapatia was elected to the prestigious position of Blessed Woman for the Lost River band of the Cherokee. Every weekend she taught the people to speak Cherokee, conducted pipe ceremonies and presided over sweat lodges, healing ceremonies.</p>
